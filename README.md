## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

#You can try running the npm update command with the --force or --legacy-peer-deps option to force npm to use an older style of dependency resolution.

npm update --force
npm update --legacy-peer-deps

#Note: Using --force or --legacy-peer-deps may lead to potential issues, and it's generally better to address the underlying dependency conflicts. Consider it as a temporary solution.
